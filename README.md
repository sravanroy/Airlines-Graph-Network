# Airlines-Graph-Network

# *Goal* :

* Implementing graph theory to solve an airline problem
* Find the shortest path between two airports in US by Distance and AirTime

# *Methodologies* :

*  The airlines data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S5c2z89SdzxSVeflWuwVT9EWHXB7Iv8Y/view) 
*  Used dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph
